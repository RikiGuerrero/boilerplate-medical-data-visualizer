# 🩺 Medical Data Visualizer

This project is an exercise from the **freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python** course.  
It uses **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** to explore and visualize medical examination data.  

The dataset includes information such as body measurements, blood test results, lifestyle choices, and the presence of cardiovascular disease.  

The project produces:  
- A **categorical plot** showing the distribution of risk factors (cholesterol, glucose, smoke, alcohol, activity, overweight) grouped by cardiovascular disease.  
- A **heatmap** of the correlation matrix after cleaning the dataset.  

The project includes unit tests in `test_module.py` to validate the solutions.
